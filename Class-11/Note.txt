Classes & Object
================

-ProtoTypes in JS
-----------------
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties adn method).

JS objects have a special property called prototype.

We can set prototype using __proto__

* if object & prototype have same method.
objects method will be used.


* Object have by default a prototype object




-Classes in JS

Class is a program-code template for creating objects.

those objects will have some state (variables) & some behavior (functions) inside it.

class MyClass {
    constructor(){...}
    myMethod(){...}
}

let myObj = new MyClass();



constructor() method is:
-----------------------
* automatically invoked by new
