Classes & Object
================

-ProtoTypes in JS
-----------------
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties adn method).

JS objects have a special property called prototype.

We can set prototype using __proto__

* if object & prototype have same method.
objects method will be used.


* Object have by default a prototype object




-Classes in JS
--------------
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.

those objects will have some state (variables) & some behavior (functions) inside it.

class MyClass {
    constructor(){...}
    myMethod(){...}
}

let myObj = new MyClass();



constructor() method is:
-----------------------
* automatically invoked by new 
* initializes object




-Inheritance in JS
------------------
inheritance is passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class.

class Parent {

}

class Child extends Parent {

}

// child => we called in programming (derived)

* if Child & Parent have same method, child's method will be used.[Method Overriding]





-super keywords in JS
---------------------
The super keywords is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent's properties and methods.


super(args) // calls Parent's constructor

super.parentMethod(args)


Uncaught ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor

-Error Handling
---------------
try-catch

try{

    ...normal code

}catch (err){

    ...handling error 

}
