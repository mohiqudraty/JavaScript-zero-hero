-Callback, Promises & Async-await
=================================


What this chapter is about?
---------------------------

async await >> promises chains >> callback hell


Sync in JS
==========
Synchronous
-----------
Synchronous means the  code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. 
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.


Asynchronous
------------
Due to Synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.


Callbacks
---------
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.


Callback hell
-------------
callback Hell: Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid if Doom)

This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.


-------------------------------------
Promises
--------
Promise is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an object in JS.
It is a solution to callback hell.

let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...}) // function with 2 handlers.

* resolve & reject are callbacks provided by JS.
 

A JavaScript Promise object can be: 
* Pending: the result is undefined
* Resolved: the result is a value (fulfilled)
* Reject: the result is an error object

resolve(result)
reject(error)

*Promise has State(pending, fulfilled) & some result(result for resolve & reject for error): 


How to handle Promises?
-----------------------
.then() & .catch()

promise.then((res)=>{...})

promise.catch((err)=>{...})


Promise Chain
