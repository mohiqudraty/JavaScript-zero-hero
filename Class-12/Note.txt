-Callback, Promises & Async-await
=================================


What this chapter is about?
---------------------------

async await >> promises chains >> callback hell


Sync in JS
==========
Synchronous
-----------
Synchronous means the  code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. 
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.


Asynchronous
------------
Due to Synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.


Callbacks
---------
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.


Callback hell
-------------
callback Hell: Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid if Doom)

This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.
