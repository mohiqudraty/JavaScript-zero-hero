-Events in JavaScript
=====================
The change in the state of an object is known as an Event
Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.

Events:

* Mouse Events (click, double click etc.)

* Form Events (submit etc.)
* Print Events & Many More...



-Event Handling in JS 
=====================
---------------------

Example:
node.event = ()=> {
     // handle here
}

Inline Event Handlingâš  (Low Priority Then JS Handling)
if we execute same handler in any html element from inline or js file will work the js file handler , JS Handler is High Priority.

and if we use same event handler in js file will work the last one!


-Event Object in JS 
===================
It is a special object that has details about the event.

All event handlers gave access to the Event Object's properties and methods.


Example:
node.event = (e)=> {
     // handle here
}

Access:
e.target, e.type, e.clientX, e.clientY




-Event Listener in JS 
=====================

node.addEventListener(event, callback)

node.removeEventListener(event, callback)


*Note: the callback reference should be same to remove.
